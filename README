Thank you for providing me the opportunity to work on this problem and showcase my skills. I have implemented the solution in Python .

First, I should start by exploring the known endpoint. Let me try some sample queries. For example, if I send a GET request to /v1/autocomplete?query=a.But how does the autocomplete work? Maybe each character added narrows down the results. For instance, query=ab would return names starting with 'ab'. So the approach would be to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on all possible prefixes. Starting with each letter a-z, then for each of those, appending another letter, and so on, until there are no more results.

The possible problems and constraints that could be present in this program can be:
1.Valid characters that be used.
2.Rate Limiting
3.Pagination
4.Query Length
5.Response Format


I will start by creating a APIscrapper class that will handle the API requests and responses. I will then create a function that will take the query as input and return the results. I will then test the function with some sample queries to see if it is working as expected. I will also handle the possible errors that could occur during the process.I will also create a function that will handle the pagination and rate limiting. I will then test the function with some sample queries to see if it is working as expected. I will also handle the possible errors that could occur during the process.

Problem 1: No. of Versions
Manually I tested there are 3 versions V1 V2 and V3. I will create a function that will handle the versioning and will test the function with some sample queries to see if it is working as expected. I will also handle the possible errors that could occur during the process.


IMPORTANT POINT:API is designed such that when a query returns exactly one name, that name is a full name. So, if I query 'alice', and the API returns ["alice"], then that's a full name. But if I query 'ali' and get ["alice"], then 'alice' is a longer name. So in this case, the API might return all names that start with the query, regardless of their length.

Problem 2: Rate Limiting
To determine the maximum request rate the API allows without triggering 429 (Too Many Requests) errors, conduct tests by sending bursts of requests with varying delays between them. Begin with a high delay and gradually decrease it in each test run. Within each burst, send multiple requests rapidly and monitor responses for any 429 errors. If a 429 error occurs, record that delay as too aggressive. After each burst, wait 5 seconds before the next test to prevent interference from previous runs.

 <<The code is Given the the rateLimit.py file>>
# Updated Rate Limit Discovery Algorithm
1. Initialize Parameters:
    - Set `initial_delay = 2.0` seconds.
    - Set `delay_decrement = 0.05` seconds (coarse search).
    - Set `delay_increment = 0.01` seconds (fine-tuning).
    - Set `min_delay = 0.05` seconds.
    - Set `batch_size = 10` requests.
    - Set `cooldown = 5` seconds.
    - Set `current_delay = initial_delay`.
    - Set `safe_delay = None`.

2. Coarse Search (Finding the Rate Limit):
    while `current_delay >= min_delay`:
        - Send `batch_size` requests with `current_delay` between them.
        - Monitor response codes.
        - if any request receives a `429` response:
            - Print "Rate limit hit at delay Xs".
            - Break the loop and proceed to fine-tuning.
        - else:
            - Store `current_delay` as `safe_delay`.
        - Reduce `current_delay` by `delay_decrement`.
        - Wait for `cooldown` seconds to allow rate limits to reset.

3. Fine-Tuning (Finding the Exact Safe Limit):
    - Set `exact_delay = safe_delay`.
    while `True`:
        - Increase `exact_delay` by `delay_increment`.
        - Send `batch_size` requests with `exact_delay` between them.
        - if any request receives a `429` response:
            - Print "Increasing delay to Xs due to rate limit".
            - Continue increasing `exact_delay`.
        - else:
            - Print "Found exact safe delay: Xs".
            - Break the loop.

4. Output Results:
    - Report `exact_delay` as the highest sustainable request rate before hitting `429`.
    - Calculate and report the **maximum sustainable requests per second (RPS)**.


But if we want to escape rate limiting without finding it we can use a backoff time to avoid it . Like if response 429 IS received , we can increase the delay time by twice and thats how rate limiting can be avoided.
    for each request:
        retries = 0
        while retries < max_retries:
            send request
            if status is 429:
                retries += 1
                time.sleep(retry_delay * 2)
            else:
                break



Problem 4: Pagination
    I had to find out whether the API supports pagination. If the API returns a fixed number of results per page, then I need to implement pagination to retrieve all results. I will create a function that will handle the pagination and will test the function with some sample queries to see if it is working as expected. I will also handle the possible errors that could occur during the process.

    def test_pagination(base_url):
        response = requests.get(base_url, params={'query': 'a', 'page': 2})
        data = response.json()
        
        if isinstance(data, dict) and 'page' in data:
            print("Pagination detected. Update code to handle pages.")
        else:
            print("No pagination detected.")
    #If pagination exists, modify the code to loop through pages:
        page = 1
        while True:
            response = requests.get(base_url, params={'query': prefix, 'page': page})
            data = response.json()
            if not data['results']:
                break
            # Process results...
            page += 1


   ## Although no Pagination is detected.

Problem 5: Query Length
    I had to find out the maximum query length the API supports. If the API has a limit on the query length, then I need to handle it in the code.To check the query length used a binay search approach .

    # to implement in the main code i need to put a check 
    MAX_QUERY_LENGTH, STRICT_LIMIT = find_max_query_length(base_url)

    # In your processing loop
    while queue:
        prefix = queue.popleft()
        
        if STRICT_LIMIT and len(prefix) > MAX_QUERY_LENGTH:
            continue
            
        # For truncating APIs
        if not STRICT_LIMIT:
            prefix = prefix[:MAX_QUERY_LENGTH]
        
        # Rest of processing...




Now to use the API atfirst I thought I have to use BFS to get to the exact extracted names but I realised that I could not retrieve all names like that because of the size limit. So brute is the the one approach i had to use . 
Algorithm for the brute force approach:--->
# Brute Force API Scraping Algorithm

1. **Initialize Parameters:**
    - Set `version` of the API.
    - Define `base_url` for API requests.
    - Determine `alphabet` based on `version`:
        - Version 1: `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`
        - Version 2: `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"`
        - Version 3+: `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_+- "`
    - Initialize `results` as an empty set to store unique results.
    - Initialize `request_count = 0` to track API requests.
    - Set initial `delay = 60` seconds to handle rate limits.
    - Set API request `limit` based on version constraints.

2. **Define a function `_fetch_query(query)`:**
    - Construct API request URL using the given `query`.
    - Send a GET request to the API.
    - If the response is successful (`200 OK`):
        - Extract `results` and add them to the set.
        - Increment `request_count`.
    - If response status is `429 Too Many Requests`:
        - Print a rate limit warning.
        - Wait for `delay` seconds before retrying.
        - Return `False` to indicate failure.
    - If any other error occurs, log the error and return `False`.

3. **Run Brute Force Query Execution (`run()`):**
    - If `version != 1`, process **single-character queries** first:
        - Loop through each character in `alphabet`.
        - Call `_fetch_query(char)`.
    - Process **two-letter queries**:
        - Generate all possible 2-character combinations from `alphabet`.
        - For each combination:
            - Call `_fetch_query(query)`.
            - If `request_count` reaches the API `limit`:
                - Wait for `delay` seconds before continuing.
            - If `_fetch_query(query)` fails:
                - Double the `delay` time to handle potential rate limits.

4. **Output Final Results:**
    - Print the total number of unique results collected.
    - Save the sorted results to a file (`results.txt`).
